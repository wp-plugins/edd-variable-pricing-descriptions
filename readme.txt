Adds an "Option Description" input field for each variable priced download.

== Description ==

This plugin requires [Easy Digital Downloads](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/easy-digital-downloads/ "Easy Digital Downloads").

EDD Variable Pricing Descriptions simply adds an "Option Description" input field for each variable priced download. This allows you to add a longer description to the option name if needed. It integrates seamlessly into the Easy Digital Downloads plugin using the provided hooks and will automatically output the description onto the front end of the website where variable priced downloads are shown.
