Easily add descriptions to variable-priced downloads in Easy Digital Downloads

== Description ==

**This plugin requires [Easy Digital Downloads](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/easy-digital-downloads/ "Easy Digital Downloads") version 1.5.2 or greater.**

EDD Variable Pricing Descriptions simply adds an "Option Description" input field for each variable-priced download. This allows you to add a longer description to the option name if needed. It integrates seamlessly into the Easy Digital Downloads plugin using the provided hooks and will automatically output the description onto the front end of the website where variable priced downloads are shown.

== Installation ==

1. Upload entire `edd-variable-pricing-descriptions` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, or just upload the ZIP package via 'Plugins > Add New > Upload' in your WP Admin
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Add optional descriptions to your variable priced downloads

= Styling =

This plugin does not add any CSS styling as it simply adds the description wrapped a `<p>` tag. The `<p>` tag does however have a class of `edd-variable-pricing-desc` should you wish to style the description more.

== Screenshots ==

1. The new "Option Description" input fields
2. The new field values being outputed onto the front-end
